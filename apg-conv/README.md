# apg-conv
There are two scripts here to demonstrate the use of **apg-conv**.
**apg-conv** must be installed globally to run the tests.
````
npm install -g apg-conv
````
The first example demonstrates the conversion of LF (\n) line ends to CRLF (\r\n).
The second converts a UTF8 encoded file to UTF16BE:BASE64.
Assume that your current directory, `./`, is the `apg-examples` directory. Then,
````
./example1
./example2
````
