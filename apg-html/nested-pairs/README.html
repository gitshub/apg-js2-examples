<h4 id="the-grammar">The Grammar</h4>

<p>The <code>grammar.bnf</code> provides a demonstration of nested recursion. It is a grammar for matching nested brackets with text. The nesting allows for multiple nested brackets within any bracket pair. </p>

<p>In this example, the brackets have been chosen as angle brackets, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, but any bracket pair could have been used. The only requirement is that the pattern (bracket) for the rule <code>L</code> canâ€™t match the pattern for the rule <code>R</code>.</p>

<h4 id="the-input">The Input</h4>

<p>The file <code>bracket-text.txt</code> is the input. It has a somewhat arbitrary selection of nested brackets with text between the brackets.</p>
